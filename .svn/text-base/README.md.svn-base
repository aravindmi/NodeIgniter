NodeIgniter
===========

Introduction
------------

The NodeIgniter is a framework ported from CodeIgniter PHP framework in Javascript for Node.js.

Inspiration
-----------

The NodeIgniter framework is inspired by the idea of Ni framework (https://github.com/chetan51/ni) and 
it is based on the concept of the Codeigniter PHP framework (http://www.codeigniter.com).

Included sources
----------------

In order to do the minimum changes through the CodeIgniter's original PHP sources I used some of the phpJS 
functions (http://www.phpjs.org) but others are just made up in situ because the phpJS coding philosophy 
is not quite suitable for this type of project.

I tried to keep the minimal third-party modules so ejs (https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) is the only 
module I used, as a template engine. It's too bad it still has no standalone support for partial views. 

Coding Philosophy
-----------------

Basically I simply converted the CodeIgniter's base and core libraries from PHP to Javascript, adjusting 
the prototyping where it needed to and keeping the CodeIgniter's folder structure so anyone who knows how 
to work with CodeIgniter surely will do just fine with NodeIgniter. The use of PHP-like functions was a 
good idea for me at that time because I only wanted to see if the pure Javascript conversion is working 
as expected. Now it seems that it does, still I know that it can be done better.

What you can do with it
-----------------------

You would simply run the command "node index.js" and go to http://localhost:3000. It will automatically 
load the default controller which is located in application/controllers/index.js. I made three methods 
available for navigation, one is the default index method, the second is a custom route and the third is 
a method that accepts parameters.

I haven't got the time to test the helpers and the models, but I expect they will work with minimal 
adjustments to the code. Anyone interested in developing this further is welcome to do whatever changes 
are necessary.

Enjoy!

I want to thank to my colleague Dan Harabor for the nodejs insights and tricks that he had kindfully given to me.
He is one of the contributors on this framework.
